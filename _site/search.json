This code is used to push things to github. First you must commit them (right hand top git tab) and then push. Can let commits build up and then push a few commits at a time.\n\n\n\nAfter you make changes you can then commit and push things. If you don’t want to use the push code, just hit green arrow to push (right hand side top git tab).\n\n\n\nOpened .gitignore file and typed Workshop_notes.qmd.

Then the site will update. Specifically netlify is reading off the _site folder. So at least push this.\nCan also fork things. You get other peoples code. Can then clone to get it onto your computer and then ask permission to send it back to the person (maybe you fixed a website typo or something)"

    "text": "Hi everyone! In this post we are going to talk about the tidyverse, specifically how to get our data into the tidy format and why this matters when using ggplot2! Are you ready to enter the tidyverse? First things first you will need to install the package “tidyverse” and then load it in you r script using the following code.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   0.3.5 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.2.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.2.2\n\n\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\n\nSo what is the tidyverse? Simply, ….. For more detailed information on the tidyverse and how to use it to its full advantage, see….. . One of the packages is ggplot2 - an amazing package that can be used to produce figures in R (think bar graphs, line graphs, scatter plots, etc.). For more information on this package see. Note, that this blog post isn’t an introduction to tidyverse or ggplot2, but rather highlights the importance making figures with tidy data. It is expected you have some background in these packages.\nSo, why does tidy data matter? Well first and foremost, and the reason for this blog post, it will make your life a lot easier when making figures in ggplot2 (a package that is loaded when you load the tidyverse)."
